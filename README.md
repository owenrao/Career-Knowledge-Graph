# Career-Knowledge-Graph
The knowledge graph consists of Job Titles and Skills. Job Title entities include attributes such as annual salary, number of
postings(demand), job descriptions, job category, and related skills. Skill entities include attributes such as skill
category(hard, soft, language), and skill description. By connecting job titles and skills and enriching their attributes,
we aim to give any employee a better understanding of the current job market, while more importantly helping them
to see their career path in a skill-based way

Employment is utterly important for graduating students like us. A great news is that, in the recent labor
market, more and more employers are shifting from unidimensional Degree-based Hiring to a much more
diverse talent acquisition mode: Skill-based Hiring (Harvard Business Review, 2022). This means that
employers care about if the candidateâ€™s skillset matches the offered position: a candidate with skills like
SQL, Spark and Python is much more competitive than someone with only Excel, Statistics and
Mathematics for positions like Data Analyst. Fortunately, a lot of those required skills are able to be
acquired using tons of online resources. Platforms like Coursera and Udemy have grown wildly in the
past few years due to the pandemic, making self-learning very accessible. Now, the question for us is:
which career should we pursue and what skills should we acquire to make us more competitive as
candidates? Our Career-skill knowledge graph is designed to answer those 2 exact questions by enriching
the knowledge on career positions and skills. Moreover, linking those two entities together enables
recommendation algorithms to advice suiting positions for students according to their current skillsets.
We aim to give any employee a better understanding of the current job market, while more importantly
helping them to see their career path in a skill-based way.
